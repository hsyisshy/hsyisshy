## Hi there
Hello, everyone. My name is Shan-Yu Hsiao, currently a sophomore at National Central University, majoring in Social Sciences and Management Information System. 
The field of Social Sciences has instilled in me a human-centered value system, and it has honed my research skills through tasks such as literature review and questionnaire interviews. 
On the other hand, the infusion of information technology has empowered me with practical skills. Through the force of technology, I advocate for issues that hold personal significance to me.
